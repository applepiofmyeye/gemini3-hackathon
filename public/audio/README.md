## Upgrading to Singaporean Theme

To replace with a Singaporean-themed soundtrack, generate one using **Google Lyria 2** (via [Replicate](https://replicate.com/google/lyria-2)):

| Prompt Suggestion                                                                                                                                             | Duration |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| "Upbeat Singaporean-inspired electronic music with gamelan percussion, modern synths, and kopitiam cafe vibes, loopable background music for a learning game" | 30-60s   |

Then replace `soundtrack.mp3` with your generated file.

## Sound Effects

The countdown beeps, correct, and wrong sound effects are generated programmatically using the Web Audio API - no files needed!
